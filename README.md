### CODE CHALLENGES

## Unit information page challenge

Given the data provided for Alice lane [AliceLaneMappedData.json](https://github.com/cameronlowry/code-challenges/blob/main/AliceLaneMappedData.json), create a react website that renders the example unit information page provided in [Gmaven unit information page (annotated).pdf](https://github.com/cameronlowry/code-challenges/blob/main/Gmaven%20unit%20information%20page%20%28annotated%29.pdf). 

 - The data mappings have been provided as comments in the design PDF
 - The colours of the output should be dynamically set according to the
   hex colour values set in the data
 - Where a colour is stated the text should use the colour from the
   data, where no colour is stated the text colour should match the
   design eg. white text.
 - The page rendered should be A4 in size so that it's printable to a
   PDF via a web browser.

Bonus challenge: Show the images at the top with the angled dividers

Example of how the component should be called:
`<UnitInformationPage data={mappedData} />`
